  <title>JS Reference VS Copy</title>

<script>
	// start with strings, numbers and booleans

  // Reference are kept different
  // Immutable dat type

	// Let's say we have an array
	const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

	// and we want to make a copy of it.

	// You might think we can just do something like this:

	// however what happens when we update that array?

	// now here is the problem!

	// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

	// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

	// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

	// one way
  const oneWay = players.reduce((acc, curr) => acc.push(curr),[]);

	// or create a new array and concat the old one in
  const concatMethod = [].concat(players);

	// or use the new ES6 Spread
  const esCopy = [...players];

	// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

	// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    console.log(oneWay, concatMethod, esCopy, )
	// with Objects
	const person = {
		name: 'Wes Bos',
		age: 80
	};

	// and think we make a copy:

	// how do we take a copy instead?
  const oldWay = Object.assign({}, person);

	// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
  const newWay = {...person};
	// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
  console.log(oldWay, newWay)
